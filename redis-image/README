This folder contains the basics of running a redis-server using a Dockerfile and accessing 
redis-cli to run applications inside the container.

We will learn that  we can run docker containers in different tabs separately with same 
Image ID, there is no exchange of files between them. Docker containers behave independently.

docker exec -it <container ID> <command>
This can be used
- when you have started redis-server in one tab, so one container has redis-server.
- Now when you want to run redis-cli in the same container, we need to link to the container. 
- Open a new tab. Run the 'exec' command to run redis-cli.
